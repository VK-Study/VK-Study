- 👋 Hi, I’m @VK-Study
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, reading novels, self improvement, learning new langauges (programming and linguistics), composing music and annoying my sister (my favourite one XD).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, java, C++ and python. I'm also learning about coding on Adruino IDE, web development and app development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a bot I'm building for my discord server. 
- 📫 You can ping me on discord (VK#4697).
