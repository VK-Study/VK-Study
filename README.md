- 👋 Hi, I’m @VK-Study
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, reading novels, self improvement, learning new langauges (programming and linguistics), composing music and annoying my sister (my favourite one XD).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java and c++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a bot I'm building for my discord server. 
- 📫 You can ping me on discord (VK#7777).
